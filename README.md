# Annual Global Happiness
Welcome to this dashboard, which provides a comprehensive look at the factors influencing world happiness, based on data from the 2016 World Happiness Report. This series of visualizations helps us explore the key drivers of happiness, understand how they are distributed globally, and see the relationships between various attributes.

**Understanding the Key Drivers of Happiness**

The first chart on our dashboard is a heatmap, which shows the correlation between several key factors and a country's Happiness Score. As you can see, there are some very strong positive correlations. The darkest squares indicate the highest correlation, and we can observe that a country's Happiness Score is most closely tied to its Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, and Health (Life Expectancy). This suggests that a country's economic prosperity and the well-being of its population are the most significant indicators of its overall happiness.

**The Effect of Wealth on Happiness**

Next, we have a scatter plot that directly visualizes the relationship between Happiness Score and GDP per Capita. Each point on the graph represents a country, and the points are colored by their Region. The plot clearly shows a strong positive trend: as a country's GDP per capita increases, its happiness score generally rises as well. The regional coloring adds a fascinating layer of insight, showing that countries within the same region often cluster together, suggesting that culture and geography play a role in happiness beyond just economic factors.

**A Global Perspective on Happiness**

To give us a clearer sense of the happiness distribution, we have a pie chart that breaks down the total Happiness Score by Region. This chart provides a high-level view, showing which regions contribute the largest share to the total happiness scores recorded in the dataset.

Complementing the pie chart is the final visualization, a world map. This map displays the GDP per Capita for each country using a color scale. The lighter the color, the higher the GDP. This visualization allows us to see the global distribution of wealth at a glance. What's even more useful is that if you hover over any country, a tooltip will appear showing its Healthy Life Expectancy. This interactive feature connects economic data with health data, reinforcing the strong link between a country's wealth and its citizens' well-being that we observed in the heatmap.

Taken together, these charts provide a clear and compelling story of what drives happiness around the world, from the most influential factors to their geographic distribution.
